# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This is a Data Analysis project on Covid-19. This is for the Machine Learning class (EE 445) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In this notebook, I provided data analysis on possible parameters that affect infection rates. The purpose of this project is to apply our understanding in Data Science methods taught in the Machine Learning course.
